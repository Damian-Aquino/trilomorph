## About the database
TriloMorph is an openly accessible database for the morpho-geometric information of trilobites, the main Palaeozoic group of marine arthropods[^1]. The database records raw landmark and semilandmark information on trilobite cephala and pygidia following the protocol proposed by Serra et al[^1]. 

The purpose of this repository is to allow the constant input of new data into the database. If you are willing to use the database for analysis, we strongly suggest downloading the stable release that is accessible in the Digital repository of the Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba and Zenodo[^2]. 

Further explanation about the R functions and how to download and analyze data hosted in this repository can be found [here](/analyze_data.md)

If you would like to help with the maintenance of the dataset and file revision, do not hesitate to contact us[^6]

Latest stable release [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/637921273.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/637921273)

## Entering new data
You can enter more than one specimen at a time. The following explanation is for a single specimen, but uploding several specimens is possible as long as you include all specimens' metadata, shape files and pictures in the same commit (see below for detailed explanation).

**Below we explain step by step the procedure to upload new data to TriloMorph:**

### Specimen
- [ ] select the specimen

  <sup>Specimens included in the database have to be housed in official collections (preferentially having a collection number) or illustrated in the scientific literature. Specimens can be cephala and/or pigydia. Be sure that the selected specimen is **not distorted**, for cephala make sure that free cheeks are in place and not slightly disarticulated.</sup>

- [ ] select the picture

  <sup>The picture used for the landmarking (see below) has to be a ***strictly dorsal*** picture of the specimen, either cephalon or pygidium. If the specimen is articulated make sure that both parts are photographed in dorsal view, if not use different pictures for each part.</sup>
  
  <sup>**IMPORTANT**: each picture has to include a graphical scale. If it is missing in the original publication, include one. You can easily include graphical scale bars with software such as ImageJ[^7]</sup>
  
  <sup>Accepted formats are PNG and JPG/JPEG. Please avoid using TIFF files</sup>

- [ ] name the picture

  <sup>The picture has to be named using the specimen's collection acronym and number. The file name must have the suffix _C when it is the cephalon, and _P for the pygidium. **Important:** If a single specimen and picture is used to landmark both cephalon and pygidium, two different files need to be created and named, one for the pygidum (_P), and one for the cephalon (_C) </sup>

### Landmarking
- [X] select the specimen
- [X] select the picture
- [x] name the picture
- [ ] landmark the specimen

  <sup>The specimen needs to be landmarked following the protocol in Serra et al[^1], which is explained in [figure 2](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40535717/preview/40535717/preview.jpg) and [table 1](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40538384/preview/40538384/preview.pdf)</sup>

  <sup>You can use various landmarking software, namely tpsDig2[^3], geomorph package for R[^4], and StereoMorph package for R[^5]. </sup>
  
  <sup>If you are using the `digitizeImages()` function from the StereoMorph package[^5], you can use our templates for landmarks and curves for [cephala](Cephala/curve.txt) and [pygidia](Pygidia/curve.txt).</sup>
  
  <sup>Please check that the final shape file is a XML-type (.txt)[^5] or TPS-type (.tps)[^3] file with the same name as the image file and their extension in lower case.</sup>

### Complete the specimen's metadata
- [X] select the specimen
- [X] select the picture
- [x] name the picture
- [x] landmark the specimen
- [ ] fill in the form

  <sub>You have to fill in the information about the specimen. **It is very important to complete the form (particularly the stratigraphic fields) relative to the _specimen_, _not the species_**
  
  A specimen's metadata is entered in the following form, please **copy and paste it as it is (including hyphens)** in a text editor and fill in each field. **If there is missing information in a field, type NA**. Fill one form per landmarked **specimen**. If a single specimen has cephalon and pygidum, just fill in a single form indicating that it has a cephalon and a pygidum.

### Upload all data to TriloMorph
- [X] select the specimen
- [X] select the picture
- [x] name the picture
- [x] landmark the specimen
- [x] fill in the form
- [ ] login to github
  
  <sup>If you don't have a github account you have to sign in first. You will only need an email, but don't be afraid using github is very simple.</sub>
  
  <sup>**If it is your first time contributing to TriloMorph, we suggest to contact us[^6] first**</sup>.

- [ ] upload the metadata
    
  Go the [specimens' metadata file](trilomorph.yaml) and press the [edit button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-47677/mw-1440/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.webp).
  
  <sup>**Important:** if this is your first time contributing to TriloMorph, github will give a [message](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539905/preview/40539905/preview.jpg) indicating that you need to fork this repository. Go ahead and **press "Fork this repository"**. Github might also [tell you that your fork is outdated](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539920/preview/40539920/preview.jpg). Don't worry, just **press "Update your fork"**.</sup>
  
  Once editing the metadata file, paste the **newly filled form(s)** in the second line (below the three hyphens [---])
       
After pasting the new form(s):
  
  * press the "commit changes..." button, which will open a [small window](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539908/preview/40539908/preview.jpg)
  * press "propose changes". The github page will now have the [heading **"Comparing changes"**](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539902/preview/40539902/preview.jpg).
  * press "Create pull request". 

After pressing the button the github page will now have the heading **Open a pull request**
 
In this page you will have a [field](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33734/mw-1440/images/help/pull_requests/select-bar.webp) where **you _must upload_ the following files**:

- [ ] upload the picture file(s)
  
  <sup>Please note that the maximum size for images is 10MB</sup>
  
- [ ] upload the landmark file(s)
    
Once you've uploaded all files, the field will look like [this](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539917/preview/40539917/preview.jpg). You can also take a look at the [preview tab](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539911/preview/40539911/preview.jpg) to make sure that the image(s) have been uploaded correctly.

**Then you must press the "Create pull request" button**.

The final step should look something similar to [this](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40539914/preview/40539914/preview.jpg)
